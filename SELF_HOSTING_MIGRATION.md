# Self-Hosting Migration Analysis: Netlify to Docker/nginx

## Current Issues with Netlify

### Timeout Problems
- **10-second hard limit** on Netlify Functions
- Your onboarding process involves multiple sequential API calls:
  1. Query Talenox for existing employees (auto-increment ID)
  2. Create employee record in Talenox
  3. Create job record in Talenox  
  4. Send email notification via Resend
- Each API call can take 2-3 seconds, easily exceeding the limit

### Root Causes
- **Sequential processing** - all operations happen synchronously
- **No caching** - employee list queried every time for ID generation
- **External API latency** - Talenox API response times vary
- **No retry mechanism** - failures require full resubmission

## Self-Hosting Benefits

### Performance & Reliability
- **No timeout limits** - can handle long-running operations gracefully
- **Request queuing** - process submissions asynchronously
- **Caching layer** - cache employee list for faster ID generation
- **Retry logic** - automatic retries for failed API calls
- **Better error handling** - partial failure recovery

### Cost & Control
- **Predictable costs** - no per-invocation charges
- **Full control** - optimize server resources as needed
- **Better debugging** - direct access to logs and metrics
- **Custom features** - add background jobs, webhooks, etc.

## Self-Hosting Challenges

### Infrastructure Management
- **Security updates** - OS, Node.js, dependencies
- **SSL certificates** - manage HTTPS (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- **Monitoring** - uptime, performance, errors
- **Backups** - database and configuration
- **Scaling** - handle traffic spikes manually

### Development Complexity
- **More code** - Express server, process management
- **Configuration** - environment variables, nginx config
- **Deployment** - no automatic CI/CD like Netlify
- **Docker knowledge** - container management

## Proposed Architecture

### Technology Stack
```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   nginx         │────▶│  Node.js App     │
│ (Reverse Proxy) │     │  (Express.js)    │
│ (Static Files)  │     │                  │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
         │                       │

         │
         └────▶ Static Assets
                (HTML/CSS/JS)
```

### Container Structure
```
docker-compose.yml
├── nginx container
│   ├── Serves static frontend
│   ├── Reverse proxy to backend
│   └── SSL termination
├── node container  
│   ├── Express.js server
│   ├── API endpoints
│   └── Background job processing
└── redis container (optional)
    ├── Cache employee data
    └── Job queue for async processing
```

## Migration Impact Analysis

### Minimal Code Changes
- Frontend stays exactly the same (just API endpoint URL)
- Backend logic mostly unchanged (just wrapped in Express)
- Same environment variables

### Significant Infrastructure Changes
- Need Docker and docker-compose setup
- nginx configuration for routing
- Process management (PM2 or similar)
- Log aggregation solution
- Monitoring/alerting setup

### Time Investment
- **Initial setup**: 1-2 days
- **Testing & debugging**: 1-2 days  
- **Production deployment**: 1 day
- **Ongoing maintenance**: 2-4 hours/month

## Recommendation

### Go with Self-Hosting If:
✅ Timeout issues are blocking business operations
✅ You have Docker/Linux administration experience
✅ You need more control over the infrastructure
✅ You expect high volume (>1000 submissions/month)
✅ You want to add async processing, queues, etc.

### Stay with Netlify If:
❌ Current timeouts are rare edge cases
❌ You prefer managed infrastructure
❌ You don't have DevOps resources
❌ Volume is low (<100 submissions/month)
❌ You value automatic deployments

## Quick Fix Alternative

Before migrating, try these optimizations on Netlify:
1. **Parallel API calls** - Use Promise.all() where possible
2. **Edge Functions** - Netlify Edge Functions have 30-second timeout
3. **Background Functions** - Netlify Background Functions have 15-minute timeout
4. **Split processing** - Return success immediately, process async
5. **Cache employee IDs** - Store in KV store or external service

## Next Steps

If proceeding with self-hosting:
1. I'll create the Express.js server code
2. I'll create Docker and nginx configurations
3. I'll provide deployment scripts
4. I'll include monitoring setup
5. I'll create migration checklist

Would you like me to proceed with creating the self-hosting setup, or would you prefer to try the Netlify optimizations first?
